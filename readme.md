# GitHub Confirm It

Quickly add repository name to confirm actions on GitHub with just a single click.

## 🧞‍♂️ Idea

Whenever I had to perform any action in from the Danger Zone section of GitHub repository options, such as:

- Change Visibility
- Transfer Ownership
- Archive Repository
- Delete Repository

It asks to write `username/repository-name`. It's tedious to write it every time you perform any of these actions or want to quickly get done with it. That's why I created this extension, which lets you quickly type that thing for you and perform the action. Just a single click away.
